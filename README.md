# launchMecs
This cite takes the variables of a catapult without any past data and predicts it's maximum range. 
It works by taking the distance and acceleration of the arc as the catapult launches to calculate the inital velocity. Using that I use basic trig equations to seperate the x and y elements 
as well as predict the total time of the launch. After that simply use the Vx with time to find range. I really wanted to use this to learn web dev basics so take the calculations with a
big grain of salt as it's very likely I did something wrong. Working out by hand though it all adds up.
